<h2>Question 1:</h2>
<p>Think about an experience where you took action that made a difference. What influence did your actions have on your life and/or on the lives of people around you? Reflect on and include the following in your answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was this experience?</li>
<li>What motivated you to take action?</li>
<li>Who was impacted by your actions? And how were they impacted?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Answer:</h3>
<p>The experience that made a significant difference in my life was the decision to sever ties with my given family and embrace my chosen family. I grew up in a very misguided community, and after years of isolation, I finally got the chance to discover the world on my own when I entered college. The person I was becoming conflicted with the expectations that were set on me by my given family. This internal conflict forced me to make a choice between those who raised me and those who accepted me. I chose the latter.
</br></br>
Initially, I believed I could balance both worlds and be there for everyone. However, it became increasingly clear that the people from my past would never be satisfied while I had another life. After enduring much accumulated exhaustion through numerous conflicts, I decided to cut them off.
</br></br>
This decision was motivated by my desire for personal growth and the need for a supportive environment that allowed me to be my true self. Severing ties with my birth family was incredibly difficult, but it was a necessary step for my well-being.
</br></br>
The impact of my actions was profound. My chosen family provided me with the love and support I needed to heal and thrive. They helped me build a new life filled with acceptance and understanding. On the other hand, my decision deeply affected my given family, and I often worry that I didn't try hard enough to reconcile with them. Despite these lingering doubts, I believe it was for the better, as it gave them a chance to move on.</p>


<h2>Question 2:</h2>
<p>Dev Degree is a marathon not a sprint. Dev Degree interns face setbacks many times throughout the program. Setbacks are a natural part of growth and our past interns have learned a lot after something doesn’t go as planned. Think about a time when you’ve experienced a setback. Maybe it was a time where you didn't meet your own expectations or the expectations of those around you.</p>

<ul><li>What are 2 to 3 of the most important learnings from a setback that you've experienced?</li></ul>

<h3>Answer:</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Setback 1: Realizing My Wrongs</b><br>
I went through a unforseen phase after severing ties with my family. Initially, I felt liberated, but soon I realized I was losing much more than I anticipated. This setback was like a sharp, quick cut. I went from an environment where I easily conformed to, and knew the rules, to one where I felt like an antagonist. Learning how to engage with others again helped me understand and embody honesty, vulnerability, and respect in a profound way.</li>
<br><li><b>Setback 2: Filling the Holes</b> <br>
Losing the sense of direction I once had was incredibly disorienting. However, this setback turned out to be a journey of self-discovery. I embraced the process of learning new habits and understanding my limits, which brought me a much-needed sense of comfort. This ongoing journey has been filled with opportunities to explore my needs and aspirations, allowing me to build a more solid and authentic foundation for myself.</li>
<br><li><b>Setback 3: Learning to Trust Others</b><br> 
The third setback was perhaps the most crucial one—learning to trust others again. Without my new family, I wouldn't have had the guidance to navigate this new world. At first, I was very discouraged to create new connections, fearing the risk of failure once more. However, the drive to learn and grow, despite the potential for setbacks, ultimately led me to form meaningful relationships. This experience has shown me the importance of relying on others and being open to new connections, even when it feels daunting.</li>

<p>At Shopify, we believe every new person that joins the company expands our culture, widens our perspectives, and adds value to our team.

<ul>
<li>What should we know about you that you haven’t already shared?</li>
